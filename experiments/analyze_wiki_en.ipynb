They were free from British rule and would not take England s convicts any more. By the 1780s the goals of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships.The Government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years.
